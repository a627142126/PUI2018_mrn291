The idea of the hypotheses is very concisely stated. </br></br>
The null and alternate hypotheses are also correctly stated both in words and using a formula </br>
I think the final data has got all the desired features for processing. My classmate has done an excellent job</br> 
of preprocessing the data.</br></br> 
We are dealing with a categorical data of two groups with a large sample size so the right fit for a statistical test would be</br> 
Chi square test. If we fit the data into a contingency table and carry out a chi square test on this data, after the independency
test, we would use odds ratio to examine effect size.</br></br>  

Caveat:</br></br> 
I just feel that in general there are more male bicycle riders in any month, and that in the two ratios used in the hypotheses, 
the denominator for male riders is going to be a lot bigger than, sometimes twice, that of women riders; so when there is</br> 
insignificant differences between male riders and female riders in the numerator, the value in the right side will always be smaller 
and I feel, not accounting for that, would introduce a bias. I dont think dividing by total number of riders is going to</br> 
help either.
