# Homework Assignment 6 for PUI2018 Evening Session

## Please note that I switched sessions with TA permission last week and so am completing the morning session homework assigned for the week of 10/3-10/4 and the evening session homework assigned for 10/11.

#### Part One
For part one, we were asked to complete a jupyter notebook that reads in PLUTO data and then uses Pandas to group the data by land use type, then compare the ratios of each type between Manhattan and Brooklyn.

To successfully run this notebook, you need to have an environmental variable named PUIDATA that references a local directory on your machine to which the data will be downloaded.

I completed this part of the assignment independently.


#### Part Two
For part two, we were asked to complete a series of SQL queries using citibike data and the CartoDB API.

I missed the class session where part of this assignment was completed so Christine Biddlecombe showed me her notes from the in-class lab, which were especially helpful for the imports and defining the function.  Otherwise I worked through the queries independently.
