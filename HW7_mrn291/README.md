# Homework Assignment 7 for PUI2018 Evening Session

#### Assignment 1
For this assignment, we were asked to do a variety of tasks involving geopandas and spatial data as well as ACS 1-year estimates, including making choropleth maps of NYC broadband access by household, mapping Link NYC stations, and comparing the two.

I completed this task independently with heavy heavy googling and matplotlib documentation.

To run this notebook sucessfully, you need to have a file called censusAPI.py in the same directory as the notebook that defines a variable called "myAPI" that represents your census API key.  Additionally, you need an environmental variable "PUIDATA" set to the directory where you will store and find your census data.  Lastly, you need to have downloaded into your PUIDATA directory the ACS 16 (not 17! learned that the hard way) 1 year estimate for PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH A BROADBAND INTERNET SUBSCRIPTION -- the file should be named ACS_16_1YR_GCT2801.ST50_with_ann.csv.
